# Movie Recommendation System using the MovieLens data set

**CSC 440 Final Project**
**Instructor:** T. F. Pawlicki, PhD
**Team Member:** Haoyu Li &Zenghe Huang

## Objective

* The main objective of this project is to build the Movie Recommendation Systems using the MovieLens data set. 
* The recommendation system shall predict the ratings of a movie that the user havenâ€™t seen yet.
* Using both user-user approach and item-item approach.

## Approach

The problem was divided into several steps:

1. **Data preprocessing:** Data was relabeled, shrinked, converted to HashMaps, and get rid of useless information.
2. **User-User Collaborative Filtering:** The algorithm uses that logic and recommends items by finding similar users to the active user to whom we are trying to recommend a movie.
3. **Item-item collaborative filtering:** The algorithm chooses items for a user, because this user has liked similar items in the past.
4. **WordCloud:** The font size is larger as the frequency of the keywords increase.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
